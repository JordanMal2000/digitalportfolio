Hello, and welcome to the websites files. This is still a working progress website, and this is something I'm trying to do in my spare time. When I did my first year at college I was taught how to make a website, however this was when we had to use Microsoft Expressions. Now that I am doing my second year I'm able to work with Abobe Dreamweaver, and this is something I am going to use in order to get the finishing wesbite. I will be using others projects, however I will be adjusting them so I can see how this works and will it work for the website.
